                <p class="gen">
                    This revision of the King James Version (KJV) was inspired by repeatedly observing that so many words and phrases in the KJV had become unclear, needed to be explained each time they were referenced, or had come to mean the opposite of what they once meant at the time of the original translation (1604-1611 AD). This is made dangerous in the case of false friends, which are instances in which a phrase makes sense when read by a modern reader, but actually had a different meaning when originally written, so that a false impression is left in the reader's mind. So, a light revision of the text with the goal of improving clarity seemed necessary if the KJV was going to continue to be used in churches without imparting unnecessary confusion.

                <p class="gen">
                    Some have undertaken a revision of the KJV before - notably the New King James Version (NKJV), and the 21st Century King James Version (KJ21). However, the NKJV is a total revision to the extent that it may as well be a new translation, and is copyrighted. The KJ21 left many difficult words and phrases unchanged, and is also copyrighted. This revision is designed to be as widely available as possible (the full text is available in a text file above), and absolutely without a copyright, being published directly into the public domain.

                    As this is a revision of a translation of Scripture, it is important to note that it is not being represented as the Word of God proper, but more precisely as an interpretation of the Word of God - first by the King James translators, and then by me - both of whom are fallible, however sincere we may be in attempting to accurately render what God inspired into another language. The King James Version has been greatly used of God in the lives of many, but it is not perfect or infallible, and neither is this revision. Every line in both the original KJV, and this 2025 revision, is ultimately to be subject to the correction of the actual Words that God inspired in the original languages. All Christians must be Bereans (Acts 17:11) when examining the Word of God, using all of the resources available to them.

                    That being said, this revision should represent a significant improvement of the KJV for the modern reader. Thousands of clarifications and updates have been made, and many pitfalls have been removed which the casual student of Scripture who only used the KJV would never have known to watch out for. The <a href="#">complete notes of the revision are available for anyone to view here</a>.
